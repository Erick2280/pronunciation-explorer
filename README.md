# Pronunciation Explorer
_Submission for Swift Student Challenge 2020_

This playground uses the [CMUDict](https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict/) dataset to view and compare the phonemes and pronunciation of English words. It can show whether two words rhyme or not, and what type of rhyme is.

You can also use this playground to explore rhymes on texts, like poems and music.

This project uses SwiftUI, and you'll need Xcode 11.4.1 or later.
