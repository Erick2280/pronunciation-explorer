# Hi there!

I'm Erick Almeida, a Computer Science student at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) and a member of the Apple Developer Academy - UFPE. Also, I'm passionate about music, and in my spare time, I write lyrics and do some cool remixes and mashups (at least I think so) :)
 
I write lyrics in English too, and sometimes I'm not sure if two words really rhyme... This inspired me to code this Playground :)
